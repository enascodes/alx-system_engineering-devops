> This project includes a collection of Bash scripts that automate various tasks in Linux. The scripts are designed to simplify routine operations and save time for users.

# Week One
As a student in software engineering, this week's curriculum covered two important topics:

0x00. Shell, navigation
In this section, we learned the basics of navigating and interacting with the Unix system. We covered topics such as listing files and directories, displaying file contents, creating and removing files and directories, and moving or copying files and directories.

0x01. Shell, permissions
In this section, we covered Linux file permissions and learned how to modify them using commands such as chmod, sudo, su, chown, and chgrp. We also learned about the three sets of permissions (owner, group, and other), how to represent them as a single digit, and how to change permissions, owner, and group of a file. Additionally, we learned how to run a command with root privileges.

Overall, these topics provide a strong foundation for understanding how to navigate and interact with the Unix system and how to manage file permissions, both of which are essential skills for software engineers.
